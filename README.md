# concours-inov-web-app

This is the repository for the web app on the Inov Competition created by the french governement which we can find multiple projects. The problem is all the project presentation is in PDFs which make the search quite difficult. This web app is here to solve the problem with a PostGreSQL Database which contains the data concerning these differents projects.

The stack that is used is :
- Python : FastAPI for the backend, SQLAlchemy for communicate with the PostGreSQL
- HTML, CSS, JS : base stack to develop web pages
- React : for the front-end to create web pages
- Chart.js : to create the graphic visualization
